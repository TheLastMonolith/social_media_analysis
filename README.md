This analyzes social media engagement data. The dataset contains user interactions such as likes, comments, posts, and user demographics. Analysis is done in python, while data is stored in MongoDB.

There are three files on this repo:
## 🐍 [00_load_local_to_mongodb.py](https://github.com/TheLastMonolith/social_media_analysis/blob/main/00_load_local_to_mongodb.py)
- This script is used to upload the .csv files into our existing MongoDB Cluster - `sm_analytics`
## 📔 [01_mongodb_queries.ipynb](https://github.com/TheLastMonolith/social_media_analysis/blob/main/01_mongodb_queries.ipynb)
